Elsewhere too, as in Viet-Nam and Malaya, existing militaryconflicts in Asia are taking heavy toll in the lives and treasure of thepeople and jeopardize the peace of other lands."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In Japan, the imposition of the separate treaty and military pact inviolation of existing International Agreements and of the will of theJapanese people for full independence and a peaceful life secured by agenuine Peace Treaty, is bringing new hardships to the Japanese peopleand threatens the peoples of the Asian and Pacific regions with theresurgence of the aggressive Japanese militarism which wrought suchgreat devastation on these peoples in World War II, while the pre-sence of foreign troops on Japanese soil threatens to involve the Japanesepeople in new wars."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Throughout the Asian and Pacific regions, the sovereignty andterritorial integrity of nations are being jeopardized by aggressive pactswhich burden the people with armaments and the stationing of foreigntroops on their soil. These pacts deprive the people of material resourcesneeded for their own welfare and economic development. Wide-spreadmilitary preparations and the existing military conflicts as in Viet-Namand Malaya are bringing ever greater oppression of the movementsfor national liberation and for the defense of national independence.These movements, by seeking to end national oppression and nationalenslavement, make a great contribution to creating the basis for thepeaceful co-existence of nations. In the name of military strategy,barriers are increasingly being raised to prevent the free economic andcultural exchange between nations which is so necessary for the prosper-ity and mutual understanding of peoples."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"We believe that by acting together for peace, the peoples of the Asianand Pacific countries can change this situation. They can bring to an endall present and potential confliets in Asia and can push back the menaceof war. By turning their common will for peace into a united force forthe defense of peace, they can win the conditions of peace which willassure full national independence and will bring to an end the disastrousconsequences of military preparations which they now suffer. They canassure the peaceful co-existence of nations with differing political andeconomic systems, based on equality between nations and on the right ofpeoples to settle their own affairs without outside interference. They canwin the application of the principles and spirit of the United NationsCharter which demands the peaceful settlement of differences betweennations and the reaching of agreement between the Great Powers. Theycan put an end to the wasteful armaments race through internationaldisarmaments and through the banning of atomic, bacteriological, chemicaland all other weapons of mass destruction.
